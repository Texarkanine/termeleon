# Creative Phase: Architecture Design

This document guides exploration of an open question about system structure - how components relate, what patterns to use, how to organize modules, where boundaries should be, or how data flows between subsystems. It is loaded by the `niko-creative` skill.

## Inputs

The `niko-creative` skill provides:
- The open question (problem statement, why it's ambiguous, constraints)
- Memory bank context (if available)

## Step 1: Clarify Requirements & Constraints

Before exploring options, nail down what the architecture must satisfy:
- **Functional requirements**: What capabilities must the system provide?
- **Quality attributes**: Which of scalability, performance, security, maintainability, and cost matter most? Rank them - architecture is about tradeoffs, and you cannot optimize for all simultaneously.
- **Technical constraints**: Existing tech stack, team expertise, deployment environment, integration points, regulatory requirements
- **Boundaries**: What is in scope for this decision? What is explicitly out of scope?

## Step 2: Identify Components & Relationships

Map the system's key components relevant to this decision:
- What are the major components, and what is each one's single responsibility?
- How do they communicate? (sync/async, request/response, event-driven, shared state)
- Where are the boundaries between components? (process boundaries, network boundaries, trust boundaries)

Use a mermaid diagram when the relationships are non-trivial - a component diagram for structure, a sequence diagram for interaction flows. Skip the diagram if the structure is simple enough that prose suffices.

## Step 3: Enumerate Options

Identify 2-4 viable architectural approaches. For each:
- Name the pattern or approach (e.g., "monolith with module boundaries", "event-driven microservices", "hexagonal architecture")
- One sentence describing how it addresses the open question
- Note if existing system patterns (from `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`) favor or conflict with this approach

## Step 4: Evaluate Tradeoffs

Compare options against the quality attributes ranked in Step 1. Use these evaluation criteria:

1. **Fitness for requirements**: Does it satisfy the functional requirements without contortion?
2. **Alignment with constraints**: Does it work within the stated technical constraints?
3. **Simplicity**: Is this the simplest architecture that meets the quality attributes? Resist adding layers, services, or abstractions that aren't demanded by requirements.
4. **Maintainability**: Can the team understand, modify, and debug it? Consider team size and expertise.
5. **Scalability**: Does it handle projected growth without rearchitecting? (But don't design for 100x if 2x is the realistic horizon.)
6. **Risk**: What is the blast radius if this choice is wrong? How reversible is it?

Use a comparison table when three or more options are evaluated:

| Criterion | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Fitness | ... | ... | ... |
| Simplicity | ... | ... | ... |
| Maintainability | ... | ... | ... |
| Scalability | ... | ... | ... |
| Risk | ... | ... | ... |

Note key insights - where options diverge, what constraints eliminate options, and which quality attributes create tension.

Guard against:
- Distributed systems where a monolith suffices
- Abstraction layers that serve no current requirement
- Scale mismatch: Copying a "big company" architecture for a small-scale problem or vice-versa

## Step 5: Decide

Select the winning option. State:
- Which option was selected
- Why it won (tied to the ranked quality attributes from Step 1)
- What was traded away (the key tradeoff(s) accepted, if any)
- Implementation notes: component boundaries, integration approach, migration path if replacing existing architecture

If no clear winner emerges, this is a **low-confidence result**, which is fine - you did the research!

## Step 6: Choice Pre-Mortem

After a winning option is selected (or before finalizing high confidence), pre-mortem **this choice** — not the whole implementation plan:

- Incantation: *If we shipped this decision and it turned out wrong, what would the likely reason be?*
- Record 1–3 likely reasons the choice would be wrong (premise, constraint, or layer mistakes — not implementation footguns)
- For each reason: mark whether it is already checked in Requirements & Constraints / evidence
- If a reason is an **unchecked** constraint or unverified assumption: do **not** finalize high confidence until it is verified, **or** return low confidence / surface to the operator

Do **not** re-run Challenges-style tech risk lists. Keep the Risk criterion in Step 4 as blast radius / reversibility — this step is a separate closing beat about *why* the choice would be wrong.

## Step 7: Output Document

# Architecture Decision: [Question Name]

## Requirements & Constraints
[Ranked quality attributes, technical constraints, scope boundaries]

## Components
[Key components and their relationships - prose or mermaid diagram]

## Options Evaluated
- **[Option A]**: [one-line summary]
- **[Option B]**: [one-line summary]

## Analysis
[Comparison table if 3+ options, or prose comparison for 2 options]

Key insights:
- [Where options diverge or constraints eliminate choices]
- [Quality attribute tensions that shaped the decision]

## Decision

### Choice Pre-Mortem

- [Likely reason this choice would be wrong]: [checked / unchecked — if unchecked, verify before high confidence or return low confidence]
- [Likely reason 2]: [checked / unchecked]

<!-- if a high-confidence result, use this format: -->

**Selected**: [Option name]
**Rationale**: [Why this won, tied to ranked quality attributes]
**Tradeoff**: [What was accepted/sacrificed]

## Implementation Notes
- [Component boundaries]
- [Integration approach]
- [Migration path if applicable]

<!-- if a low-confidence result, use this format: -->

**Low-Confidence Result**: [Why no clear winner emerged — include Choice Pre-Mortem above when an unchecked reason (or similar) drove the escalation]
