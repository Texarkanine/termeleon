# Creative Phase: Generic

This document guides exploration of an open question that doesn't fit one of the specialized creative phase types. It covers the long tail: naming conventions, testing strategies, process decisions, tooling choices, configuration approaches, data modeling, API design, and anything else where the approach is genuinely ambiguous. It is loaded by the `niko-creative` skill.

## Inputs

The `niko-creative` skill provides:
- The open question (problem statement, why it's ambiguous, constraints)
- Memory bank context (if available)

## Step 1: Frame the Decision

State precisely what needs to be decided. Include:
- **What**: The specific choice to be made (not the surrounding context - just the decision point)
- **Why it matters**: What downstream work depends on this decision, or what goes wrong if the wrong choice is made
- **Constraints**: List the invariants and constraints that the correct solution must preserve. What are the hard requirements, compatibility needs, team preferences, or organizational standards that bound the option space?

Do not proceed until the decision is scoped tightly enough that "we decided X" would be a meaningful, actionable statement.

## Step 2: Enumerate Options

Identify 2-4 viable approaches. For each:
- Name the approach
- One sentence describing how it addresses the open question
- Note if existing project patterns (from `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`) or tech context (from `memory-bank/techContext.md`) favor or conflict with this approach

## Step 3: Analyze Tradeoffs

Compare options against criteria relevant to THIS specific decision. There is no fixed evaluation rubric for generic decisions - instead, derive the criteria from the constraints and "why it matters" in Step 1.

Common criteria to consider (use only those that apply):
- **Consistency**: Does it align with existing project patterns and conventions?
- **Simplicity**: Is this the simplest approach that satisfies the constraints?
- **Maintainability**: Will the team understand this in six months?
- **Reversibility**: How costly is it to change this decision later?
- **Scope of impact**: How many files, modules, or workflows does this affect?

Use a comparison table when three or more options are evaluated:

| Criterion | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

Note key insights - the non-obvious tradeoffs or constraints that eliminate options.

Guard against:
- Bikeshedding (spending disproportionate effort on low-impact decisions)
- Choosing novelty over convention without clear benefit
- Optimizing for a criterion that doesn't actually matter for this decision

## Step 4: Decide

Select the winning option. State:
- Which option was selected
- Why it won (tied to the specific constraints and criteria from Steps 1 and 3)
- What was traded away (the key tradeoff(s) accepted, if any)
- Implementation notes: what changes, where, and any follow-on actions

If no clear winner emerges, this is a **low-confidence result**, which is fine - you did the research!

## Step 5: Output Document

Write to `memory-bank/active/creative/creative-[question-name].md`:

# Decision: [Question Name]

## Context
[What needs to be decided, why it matters, constraints]

## Options Evaluated
- **[Option A]**: [one-line summary]
- **[Option B]**: [one-line summary]

## Analysis
[Comparison table if 3+ options, or prose comparison for 2 options]

Key insights:
- [Non-obvious tradeoff or finding]
- [Constraint that shaped the decision]

## Decision

<!-- if a high-confidence result, use this format: -->

**Selected**: [Option name]
**Rationale**: [Why this won, tied to constraints and criteria]
**Tradeoff**: [What was accepted/sacrificed]

## Implementation Notes
- [What changes]
- [Where]
- [Follow-on actions]

<!-- if a low-confidence result, use this format: -->

**Low-Confidence Result**: [Why no clear winner emerged]
