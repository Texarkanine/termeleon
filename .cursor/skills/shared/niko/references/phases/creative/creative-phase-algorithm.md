# Creative Phase: Algorithm Design

This document guides exploration of an open question about logic and computation - how to solve a specific problem, what data structures to use, how to handle complex transformations, or performance-sensitive processing. It is loaded by the `niko-creative` skill.

## Inputs

The `niko-creative` skill provides:
- The open question (problem statement, why it's ambiguous, constraints)
- Memory bank context (if available)

## Step 1: Define the Problem

State precisely what needs to be computed or solved. Include:
- **Input/Output**: Data types, ranges, volumes
- **Requirements**: Performance targets, accuracy needs, resource constraints
- **Invariants**: What must always hold true regardless of approach

Do not proceed until the problem is concrete enough that two engineers would agree on what "correct" means.

## Step 2: Enumerate Options

Identify 2-4 viable algorithmic approaches. For each:
- Name the algorithm or technique
- One sentence describing the approach
- Note if an existing library or standard implementation covers it

Prefer well-known algorithms over novel ones. Prefer library implementations over custom ones.

## Step 3: Analyze Tradeoffs

Compare options against these criteria, in priority order:

1. **Correctness**: Does it solve the stated problem for all valid inputs?
2. **Simplicity**: Is this the simplest approach that meets requirements? (KISS)
3. **Reuse**: Can we use an existing, tested implementation? (DRY)
4. **Maintainability**: Can the team understand and modify it?
5. **Time complexity**: Big-O for expected and worst case
6. **Space complexity**: Memory usage at expected scale

Use a comparison table when three or more options are evaluated:

| Criterion | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Correctness | ... | ... | ... |
| Simplicity | ... | ... | ... |
| Time | O(?) | O(?) | O(?) |
| Space | O(?) | O(?) | O(?) |

Note key insights - the non-obvious tradeoffs, edge cases where options diverge, or constraints that eliminate options.

Guard against:
- Premature optimization (e.g. solving for scale you don't have)
- Reinventing the wheel (e.g. a library already does this)
- Over-engineering for hypothetical future requirements (YAGNI)

## Step 4: Decide

Select the winning option. State:
- Which option was selected
- Why it won (tied to the specific requirements and constraints)
- What was traded away (the key tradeoff(s) accepted, if any)
- Implementation notes: edge cases to handle, performance considerations, integration points

If no clear winner emerges, this is a **low-confidence result**, which is fine - you did the research!

## Step 5: Output Document

Write to `memory-bank/active/creative/creative-[question-name].md`:

# Algorithm Decision: [Question Name]

## Problem
[What needs to be computed/solved, inputs/outputs, constraints]

## Options Evaluated
- **[Option A]**: [one-line summary]
- **[Option B]**: [one-line summary]

## Analysis
[Comparison table if 3+ options, or prose comparison for 2 options]

Key insights:
- [Non-obvious tradeoff or finding]
- [Edge case or constraint that shaped the decision]

## Decision

<!-- if a high-confidence result, use this format: -->

**Selected**: [Option name]
**Rationale**: [Why this won, tied to requirements]
**Tradeoff**: [What was accepted/sacrificed]

## Implementation Notes
- [Edge case handling]
- [Performance consideration]
- [Integration point]

<!-- if a low-confidence result, use this format: -->

**Low-Confidence Result**: [Why no clear winner emerged]
