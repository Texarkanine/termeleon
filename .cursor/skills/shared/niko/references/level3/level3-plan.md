# Plan Phase - Level 3: Intermediate Feature

This document creates a concrete implementation plan for a Level 3 (Intermediate Feature) task. It includes component analysis, cross-module dependency mapping, and open question identification. If any aspect of the design is genuinely ambiguous, this phase flags it as an open question and invokes the `niko-creative` phase to resolve it before finalizing the plan.

## Step 1: Load Memory Bank Files

Read:
- `memory-bank/active/tasks.md`
- `memory-bank/active/projectbrief.md`
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`
- `memory-bank/active/activeContext.md`
- `memory-bank/techContext.md`
- `.cursor/rules/shared/always-tdd.mdc`

Also read any existing creative phase documents in `memory-bank/active/creative/` - these contain decisions from previous creative phase invocations on this task (if the plan phase has already looped through creative once or more).

## Step 2: Verify Prerequisites

- Confirm `memory-bank/active/tasks.md` exists (stub created by `/niko`)
- Confirm `memory-bank/active/progress.md` exists and indicates Level 3
- Confirm `memory-bank/active/projectbrief.md` exists with the user story and requirements

🚨 If any prerequisites are missing, STOP and inform the operator (see "Output to Operator" below).

## Step 3: Component Analysis

L3 tasks touch multiple components or modules. Map the scope:
- **Affected components**: List every module, service, or subsystem this feature touches. For each, note what changes are needed and what its current responsibilities are.
- **Cross-module dependencies**: Identify how the affected components interact. Which components call which? What data flows between them? Are there shared state or concurrency concerns?
- **Boundary changes**: Will this feature change any component's public interface, API contract, or data schema? Flag these - they have higher blast radius and may need creative phase exploration.
- **Cross-reference against `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`** to confirm the planned touchpoints align with established patterns. If they don't, that's an open question.
- **Invariants & Constraints:** List the properties the correct solution must preserve or that must hold for the plan to be valid. Prefer positive framing ("must preserve X" / "must hold Y"). Include plan-level properties where they matter — safety, compatibility, and non-goals as preserved boundaries — not only technical stack constraints.

## Step 4: Identify Open Questions

Scan the requirements, component analysis, and your understanding of the implementation for genuine ambiguity. An open question exists when:
- You cannot confidently describe HOW to implement something without exploring alternatives
- Multiple viable approaches exist and the right choice depends on tradeoffs that need evaluation
- The requirements are ambiguous enough that two engineers might build different things

For each open question, document in `memory-bank/active/tasks.md`:
- A brief problem statement describing what needs to be decided
- Why it's ambiguous (what makes multiple approaches viable)
- Any constraints or requirements the decision must satisfy

**If there are no open questions**, skip to Step 6. Not every L3 task has ambiguity - some are complex but clear.

**If there are open questions**, proceed to Step 5.

## Step 5: Invoke Creative Phase

For each open question identified in Step 4, invoke the `niko-creative` skill.
The creative phase will:
- Route to the appropriate creative phase type (algorithm, architecture, uiux, or generic)
- Explore options and evaluate tradeoffs
- Return either a resolved decision (high confidence) or unresolved findings (low confidence)

**High confidence**: Integrate the decision into the plan. The creative document in `memory-bank/active/creative/` is the record. Continue to the next open question or to Step 6 if all open questions have been investigated..

**Low confidence**: The creative phase will surface findings to the operator and stop. When the operator provides direction, they will re-enter this plan phase by invoking the `niko-plan` skill. The creative document will contain the operator's decision, and Step 1 will pick it up.

Process open questions one at a time. After each creative phase completes, reassess: did the decision eliminate or create other open questions? Adjust the list before proceeding to the next one.

## Step 6: Test Planning (TDD)

- **Behavior Identification**: Enumerate the specific, observable behaviors this feature must exhibit when complete. Frame as `[input/action] → [expected outcome]`. For L3, this includes behaviors at component boundaries, not just the feature's public interface. List behaviors only for executable work; do not invent tests for prose/policy units.
- **Edge Cases**: Invalid input, boundary values, empty/null states, interaction with existing behavior, cross-component failure modes, concurrency edge cases if applicable.
- **Test Infrastructure Survey**: Locate the project's existing test framework, runner, conventions, and directory structure. New tests must conform. If no test infrastructure exists, flag as a blocking question.
- **Test File Mapping**: For each behavior, specify the exact test file and describe the test case. Group by component/module. Distinguish unit tests (within a component) from integration tests (across components).

## Step 7: Create Implementation Plan

- Produce an **ordered** list of implementation steps, grouped by component/module.
- Each step names concrete files and functions.
- Classify each step as **executable** or **prose/policy**.
- For an **executable** step, numbered substeps are the always-tdd stages in order: stub tests, stub interface, write tests and run red, write code and run green. Put the specific changes (new functions, modified signatures, added exports, config changes) in those substeps. If the substeps can be reordered and still read correctly, the step is not planned yet.
- For a **prose/policy** step, use ordered work steps plus `No tests: prose/policy artifact`. Never schedule a change-detector.
- Steps must be sequenced so that each builds on the last. For multi-component features, start with the component that has the fewest dependencies and work outward.
- Include documentation update steps for any project documentation (README files, doc comments, configuration docs, user-facing guides) that would be affected by the implementation. Documentation changes are implementation work, not an afterthought.
- Reference creative phase decisions where they inform implementation choices.
- Identify key relationships or designs that would be more-clearly communicated with a diagram (flowchart, sequence diagram, entity relationship diagram, or UML diagram), than with prose. These diagrams will either be "pinned" at the top of the task list if they apply generally to the whole plan, or placed later on near the most-relevant section.

## Step 8: Identify Challenges & Mitigations

- For each non-trivial step, note what could go wrong and how to handle it
- Flag any dependency on external state (APIs, environment, config) that must be present during build
- Flag any cross-component integration risks
- If any challenge suggests the task is actually Level 4 (requires milestone decomposition, multiple independent workstreams): FAIL with recommendation to re-level

## Step 9: Pre-Mortem

After Challenges & Mitigations are recorded, run Pre-Mortem on the whole plan:

- Imagine this plan has already failed. What would the likely cause(s) be?
- For each likely cause: say how the plan changes in response (scope cut, new step, new open question, stronger invariant, etc.), or note in one line that a Challenge already covers it and move on
- Do **not** re-list the Challenges & Mitigations as a dump — Pre-Mortem is prospective hindsight on the plan as a whole (wrong premise, wrong layer, missing constraint), not another tech-risk register

## Step 10: Technology Validation

- Document any new dependencies, build tool changes, or configuration additions
- If new technology is introduced: create a minimal proof-of-concept that verifies the dependency installs, builds, and runs in the project's environment
- If no new technology: skip this step and note "No new technology - validation not required"

## Step 11: Generate Plan Report

1. Write the complete plan to `memory-bank/active/tasks.md` using the format below
