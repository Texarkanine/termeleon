# Build Phase - Level 3: Intermediate Feature

This document executes the implementation plan produced by the Level 3 Plan phase. It follows the plan step-by-step with TDD, reviews creative phase decisions before building, works module-by-module, and runs integration tests across components after individual modules pass.

## Step 1: Load Memory Bank Files

Read:
- `memory-bank/active/tasks.md`
- `memory-bank/active/activeContext.md`
- `memory-bank/active/projectbrief.md`
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`
- `memory-bank/techContext.md`
- `memory-bank/active/progress.md`
- All files in `memory-bank/active/creative/` (creative phase decisions)

## Step 2: Verify Prerequisites

- Confirm `memory-bank/active/.preflight-status` exists and its first line is exactly `PASS` or `PASS WITH ADVISORY`
- Confirm `memory-bank/active/tasks.md` contains a complete implementation plan with component analysis, resolved open questions, test plan, and ordered implementation steps
- Confirm all open questions in the plan are marked resolved (or explicitly deferred by the operator)
- 🚨 If `.preflight-status` is missing: STOP — Spawn a subagent (prefer smarter / different family if available); the only instruction you add is `` Run the `/niko-preflight` skill ``. Do not run the skill in this conversation. Re-check `memory-bank/active/.preflight-status` before continuing.
- 🚨 If the first line is `FAIL (fixable)`: STOP — invoke the `niko-plan` skill.
- 🚨 If the first line is `FAIL (blocking)`: STOP — operator provides guidance, then `/niko-plan`.
- 🚨 If the implementation plan is missing or incomplete: STOP - invoke the `niko-plan` skill.
- 🚨 If unresolved open questions remain: STOP - inform the operator.

## Step 3: Review Creative Decisions

Before writing any code, review every creative phase document in `memory-bank/active/creative/`. For each decision:
- Understand what was decided and why
- Note the implementation notes - these are direct inputs to how you build
- Confirm the decision is still valid given the current state of the codebase (if not, flag to operator - don't silently deviate)

This step exists because creative decisions may have been made during planning, potentially several sessions ago. Build must not drift from those decisions without explicit operator approval.

## Step 4: Execute Implementation

Work through the implementation plan in `memory-bank/active/tasks.md` **in order**, grouped by component/module as specified in the plan. For each step:

1. Follow the defined TDD process: stub tests → stub interface → write tests → run tests (expect red) → write code → run tests (expect green)
2. If a step references a creative phase decision, verify the implementation conforms to that decision
3. If a step fails in a way the plan did not anticipate:
    - **Recoverable** (typo, minor API misunderstanding): fix and continue
    - **Plan deficiency** (wrong approach, missing dependency, broken assumption): FAIL - the plan needs revision
    - **Creative decision invalid** (the decided approach doesn't work in practice): FAIL - needs creative re-exploration
4. After finishing the last step in a section's list, update `memory-bank/active/tasks.md` to check off the completed step(s).

When finishing a component/module's steps, run that component's unit tests in full before moving to the next component.

## Step 5: Integration Testing

After all component-level implementation steps are complete:

1. Run integration tests that span component boundaries (as specified in the test plan)
2. Run the full project test suite to confirm no regressions
3. Run any linters and/or formatters to confirm mechanical correctness
4. Run any build or packaging processes to confirm no regressions

If integration tests fail:
- **Interface mismatch** (components don't communicate as planned): fix at the boundary, re-run
- **Architectural issue** (the integration approach itself is flawed): FAIL - needs plan revision

## Step 6: Update Memory Bank

1. Update `memory-bank/active/tasks.md`: mark Build phase complete in the Status section
2. Update `memory-bank/active/activeContext.md` with:
    - Files created or modified
    - Key implementation decisions made during build (not already in creative docs)
    - Any deviations from the plan and why
    - Integration test results

## Step 7: Log Progress

> 🚨 **Printing this notice is NOT the end of this phase.** After printing, continue immediately to the next step - do not stop.

Log the results depending on the build outcome by printing the appropriate block:

### PASS

~~~markdown
# Build Result

✅ PASS - Level 3

## Summary

- **Implementation steps completed**: [X/X]
- **Components built**: [list]
- **Tests passing**: [count] (including [count] new, [count] integration)
- **Files modified**: [list]
- **Creative decisions applied**: [count]

## Deviations from Plan

[Any deviations and rationale, or "None - built to plan"]

## Next Steps

QA review will now run automatically.
~~~

### FAIL

~~~markdown
# Build Result

❌ FAIL

## Reason

[What failed and why]

## Step That Failed

[Which implementation step, what was attempted, what went wrong]

## Next Steps

- **Plan deficiency**: Return to `/niko-plan` to revise the implementation approach.
- **Creative decision invalid**: Return to `/niko-plan` - the relevant open question needs re-exploration.
- **External blocker**: Operator input required - [describe what's needed].
~~~

## Step 8: Phase Transition

- If operator input is required: stop and wait for them.
- If operator input is not required: load the appropriate complexity level-specific Niko workflow file, then use its Phase Mappings to execute the next phase.
