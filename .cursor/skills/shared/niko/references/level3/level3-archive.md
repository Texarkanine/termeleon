# Archive Phase - Level 3: Intermediate Feature

This document guides archiving for a Level 3 task. The archive is the full story of the feature - a reader should be able to understand what was built, why design decisions were made, and what was learned, entirely from this one document.

For Level 4 tasks that load this document: additionally include architectural context (how this change fits into the broader system), deployment or migration notes if applicable, and maintenance considerations for future developers.

## Step 1: Load Memory Bank Files

Read:
- `memory-bank/active/tasks.md`
- `memory-bank/active/activeContext.md`
- `memory-bank/active/progress.md`
- `memory-bank/active/projectbrief.md`
- `memory-bank/active/reflection/` (all files)
- `memory-bank/active/creative/` (all files)

## Step 2: Verify Prerequisites

- Check that `memory-bank/active/reflection/reflection-<task-id>.md` exists
- If no reflection exists: 🛑 STOP - it does not make sense to archive work that hasn't been reflected on. Ask the operator for clarification, and wait for their instructions. You're done for now.

## Step 3: Determine Archive Category

Based on the task's nature (not its complexity level):
- `bug-fixes/` - something was wrong, now corrected
- `enhancements/` - an existing feature or capability improved or extended
- `features/` - an entirely new feature or capability added
- `systems/` - a major architectural or system-wide change

## Step 4: Create Archive Document

Create `memory-bank/archive/<category>/YYYYMMDD-<task-id>.md`.

The archive format is defined in `.cursor/rules/shared/niko/memory-bank/archives.mdc` - follow that format. For Level 3, this means full treatment:

- **Inline all ephemeral content.** Creative phase decisions with rationale, reflection insights, plan details - all of it gets written into the archive document directly, because the ephemeral memory-bank files are about to be deleted. The archive must stand completely on its own.
- **Document the implementation approach** and key files touched, so a future developer can understand how the feature was built.
- **Inline creative phase decisions** with the options considered, the rationale for the choice, and any friction points discovered during implementation.
- **Inline reflection insights** - both technical and process.

If a section has no meaningful content (e.g., no technical improvements surfaced), include the section header with a brief note explaining why it's empty. Don't silently omit sections.

## Step 5: Clear Ephemeral Files

1. Delete the "ephemeral" memory-bank files.
2. **PRESERVE** the "persistent" memory-bank files - do NOT touch them.

## Step 6: Commit

Commit all changes (the new archive document + the deleted ephemeral files) with:

```
chore: archive <task-id> and clear memory bank
```

## Step 7: Output to Operator

When archiving is complete, print:

~~~markdown
# Archive Result

## Summary

Archived as `memory-bank/archive/<category>/YYYYMMDD-<task-id>.md`

## Cleaned Up

[List of ephemeral files deleted]

## Next Steps

Memory bank is clean and ready for the next task.

Type `/niko` to begin.

Then, wait for operator input.
