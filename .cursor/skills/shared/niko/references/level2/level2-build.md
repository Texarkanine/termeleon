# Build Phase - Level 2: Simple Enhancement

This document executes the implementation plan produced by the Level 2 Plan phase. It follows the plan step-by-step, applying TDD for each implementation step, and tracks progress in the memory bank.

## Step 1: Load Memory Bank Files

Read:
- `memory-bank/active/tasks.md`
- `memory-bank/active/activeContext.md`
- `memory-bank/active/projectbrief.md`
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`
- `memory-bank/active/progress.md`

## Step 2: Verify Prerequisites

- Confirm `memory-bank/active/.preflight-status` exists and its first line is exactly `PASS` or `PASS WITH ADVISORY`
- Confirm `memory-bank/active/tasks.md` contains a complete implementation plan (produced by the Plan phase)
- Confirm the task's test plan is present: behaviors to verify, test infrastructure, and test file mapping

🚨 If `.preflight-status` is missing: STOP — Spawn a subagent (prefer smarter / different family if available); the only instruction you add is `` Run the `/niko-preflight` skill ``. Do not run the skill in this conversation. Re-check `memory-bank/active/.preflight-status` before continuing.
🚨 If the first line is `FAIL (fixable)`: STOP — invoke the `niko-plan` skill and proceed as instructed there.
🚨 If the first line is `FAIL (blocking)`: STOP — operator provides guidance, then `/niko-plan`.
🚨 If the implementation plan is missing or incomplete: STOP - invoke the `niko-plan` skill and proceed as instructed there.

## Step 3: Execute Implementation

Work through the implementation plan in `memory-bank/active/tasks.md` **in order**. For each step:

1. Follow the defined TDD process: stub tests → stub interface → write tests → run tests (expect red) → write code → run tests (expect green)
2. After each step passes, update `memory-bank/active/tasks.md` to check off the completed step
3. If a step fails in a way the plan did not anticipate, stop and assess:
   - **Recoverable** (typo, minor misunderstanding of API): fix and continue
   - **Plan deficiency** (wrong approach, missing dependency, broken assumption): FAIL - the plan needs revision

Do not skip steps. Do not reorder steps. The plan was validated by preflight; trust the sequence.

## Step 4: Verify Completion

When all implementation steps are checked off:

1. Run the full test suite (not just new tests) to confirm no regressions
2. Run lint and build to confirm mechanical correctness
3. Verify every behavior from the test plan has a passing test

## Step 5: Update Memory Bank

1. Update `memory-bank/active/tasks.md`: mark Build phase complete in the Status section
2. Update `memory-bank/active/activeContext.md` with:
   - Files created or modified (absolute paths)
   - Key implementation decisions made during build
   - Any deviations from the plan and why

## Step 6: Log Progress

> 🚨 **Printing this notice is NOT the end of this phase.** After printing, continue immediately to the next step - do not stop.

Log the results depending on the build outcome by printing the appropriate block:

### PASS

~~~markdown
# Build Result

✅ PASS - Level 2

## Summary

- **Implementation steps completed**: [X/X]
- **Tests passing**: [count] (including [count] new)
- **Files modified**: [list]

## Deviations from Plan

[Any deviations and rationale, or "None - built to plan"]

## Next Steps

QA review will now run automatically.
~~~

### FAIL

~~~markdown
# Build Result

❌ FAIL

## Reason

[What failed and why]

## Step That Failed

[Which implementation step, what was attempted, what went wrong]

## Next Steps

- **Plan deficiency**: Return to `/niko-plan` to revise the implementation approach.
- **External blocker**: Operator input required - [describe what's needed].
~~~

## Step 7: Phase Transition

- If operator input is required: stop and wait for them.
- If operator input is not required: load the appropriate complexity level-specific Niko workflow file, then use its Phase Mappings to execute the next phase.
