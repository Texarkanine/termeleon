# Task Complexity Determination

Determine the appropriate complexity level (1-4) for a task, then write the determination to the memory bank and load the corresponding workflow.

## Step 1: Classification Target

Determine what to classify. If `memory-bank/active/milestones.md` exists, read it - the classification target is the description of the first unchecked (`- [ ]`) milestone. Otherwise, the classification target is the user's task input.

## Step 2: Decision Tree

## Complexity Indicators

### Level 1: Quick Bug Fix
- **Signals**: "fix", "broken", "not working", "bug", "error", "crash"
- **Scope**: Single component or UI element
- **Risk**: Low, isolated changes
- **Examples**: broken button, styling glitch, validation error, typo, broken link

### Level 2: Simple Enhancement
- **Signals**: "add", "improve", "update", "change", "enhance", "modify"
- **Scope**: Single component or subsystem
- **Risk**: Moderate, contained to specific area
- **Examples**: add form field, improve validation, update styling, enhance existing component

### Level 3: Intermediate Feature
- **Signals**: "implement", "create", "develop", "build", "feature"
- **Scope**: Multiple components, complete feature
- **Risk**: Significant, affects multiple areas
- **Examples**: user authentication flow, dashboard, search functionality, complex form system

### Level 4: Complex System
- **Signals**: "system", "architecture", "redesign", "integration", "framework"
- **Scope**: Multiple subsystems or entire application
- **Risk**: High, architectural implications
- **Examples**: payment processing framework, microservice architecture, database migration system, real-time communication system

## Step 3: Assessment Questions

When the decision tree doesn't give a clear answer, consider:

1. **Scope** - Single component, multiple components, or system-wide?
2. **Design decisions** - Can you start coding immediately, or do you need to explore and choose between approaches first?
3. **Risk** - What breaks if this goes wrong? Is it isolated or cascading?
4. **Effort** - Hours, days, or weeks?

## Step 4: Write Determination to Memory Bank

Create any **missing** ephemeral files as described below. Preserve files that already exist (e.g., `progress.md` and `projectbrief.md` retained from a rework re-entry).

**`memory-bank/active/projectbrief.md`** - Capture the user story and requirements: Populate it from the user's input (validated upstream by the intent clarification step).

**`memory-bank/active/activeContext.md`** - Record the current session state:

- **Current Task** - task name derived from the user's request
- **Phase** - `COMPLEXITY-ANALYSIS - COMPLETE`
- **What Was Done** - complexity level determined (Level N) and rationale
- **Next Step** - load the Level N workflow

**`memory-bank/active/tasks.md`** - Stub the task list:

Create a stub file with the task name. Do **not** populate checklists yet - the level-specific planning rules prescribe the exact format and content.

**`memory-bank/active/progress.md`** - If `milestones.md` exists: create a brand-new `progress.md` (old content is stale). Otherwise: create only if absent (preserves rework history).

Load: `.cursor/rules/shared/niko/memory-bank/active/progress.mdc` and create the file by following the instructions in the rule.

The initial summary should describe the work to be done as laid out in `projectbrief.md`, and the rule's `**Complexity:**` field must be populated. That field is the **system of record** for the task's complexity level - other files may display it, but `progress.md` is the canonical source.

## Step 5: Log Progress

After writing the determination, inform the user:

```markdown
✅ **Complexity Analysis Complete** - Level N determined.
Loading Level N workflow...
```

## Step 6: Load Workflow

Load the level-specific workflow and use its Phase Mappings to execute the next phase.

- Level 1: `.cursor/skills/shared/niko/references/level1/level1-workflow.md`
- Level 2: `.cursor/skills/shared/niko/references/level2/level2-workflow.md`
- Level 3: `.cursor/skills/shared/niko/references/level3/level3-workflow.md`
- Level 4: `.cursor/skills/shared/niko/references/level4/level4-workflow.md`
