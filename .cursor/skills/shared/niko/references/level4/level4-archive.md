# Archive Phase - Level 4: Capstone Archive

This document guides the capstone archive for a completed Level 4 task. It consolidates the entire project: the milestone list and how it evolved, each sub-run's key outcomes (inlined from their reflection documents), and the final state of the system. No separate capstone reflect is needed - sub-run reflections already captured the retrospective work; this phase combines and distills them.

## Step 1: Load Memory Bank Files

Read:
- `memory-bank/active/milestones.md`
- `memory-bank/active/projectbrief.md`
- `memory-bank/active/activeContext.md`
- `memory-bank/active/progress.md`
- `memory-bank/active/reflection/` (all files - the sub-run reflections)

## Step 2: Verify Prerequisites

- Confirm **all milestones are checked** (`- [x]`) in `memory-bank/active/milestones.md`

🚨 If any milestones remain unchecked: STOP - the project is not complete. Inform the operator which milestones remain, then wait for their instructions.

## Step 3: Determine Archive Category

L4 tasks almost always belong in `systems/` - they represent major, multi-run system changes. Use a different category only if the full scope of the project clearly fits a narrower one (e.g., all milestones were bug fixes → `bug-fixes/`).

## Step 4: Create Archive Document

Create `memory-bank/archive/<category>/YYYYMMDD-<task-id>.md`.

The archive format is defined in `.cursor/rules/shared/niko/memory-bank/archives.mdc`. For Level 4, full treatment with these additional sections:

- **Milestone List**: Include the complete original milestone list. Note any milestones that were added, removed, re-scoped, or reordered during execution, and why.
- **Sub-Run Summaries**: For each completed milestone, inline the key outcomes from its reflection document - what was built, key decisions made, significant friction encountered. Do not link; inline the substance.
- **System State**: Describe the final state of the system after all sub-runs: what exists now that didn't before, what changed, what the integration looks like end-to-end.
- **Cross-Run Insights**: Patterns that emerged across multiple sub-runs - recurring friction, design decisions that compounded across milestones, process observations specific to the multi-run structure. Pay special attention to any "Million-Dollar Question" results that emerged across the sub-runs.

If a section has no meaningful content, include the header with a brief note explaining why.

## Step 5: Clear Ephemeral Files

1. Delete the "ephemeral" memory-bank files.
2. **PRESERVE** the "persistent" memory-bank files - do NOT touch them.

## Step 6: Commit

Commit all changes (archive document + deleted ephemeral files  & all code changes) with:

```
chore: archive <task-id> and clear memory bank
```

## Step 7: Log Progress

Print a summary of the archive according to the following format:

~~~markdown
# Capstone Archive Result

## Summary

Archived as `memory-bank/archive/<category>/YYYYMMDD-<task-id>.md`

## Milestones Completed

- [milestone 1 - one-line outcome]
- [milestone 2 - one-line outcome]

## Cleaned Up

[List of ephemeral files deleted, including milestones.md]

## Next Steps

Memory bank is clean and ready for the next task.

Type `/niko` to begin.

Then wait for operator input.
