# Agent context

Tracked agent-facing project knowledge lives under `memory-bank/`. Prefer those files over inventing project facts.

## Persistent files

- `memory-bank/productContext.md` — business context: users, use cases, success criteria, constraints
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` — architecture and naming patterns in use
- `memory-bank/techContext.md` — stack, tools, and how to work in this repo

## Archives

Completed work is summarized under `memory-bank/archive/<kind>/YYYYMMDD-<task-id>.md`.

## Active work

`memory-bank/active/` holds the current-task execution trace. If those files exist, an in-flight task may be underway — consult them before starting work that could collide.

## When to load

When the task needs project, architecture, or stack context, read the relevant persistent file(s). Do not load every memory-bank file on every chat.
